--- abstract

This document describes a scheme for hybrid public key encryption (HPKE).  This
scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts
for a recipient public key. It also includes a variant that authenticates
possession of a pre-shared key. HPKE works for any combination of an
asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption
with additional data (AEAD) encryption function. We provide instantiations of
the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve
Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF),
and SHA2.

# Introduction

Encryption schemes that combine asymmetric and symmetric algorithms have been
specified and practiced since the early days of public key cryptography, e.g.,
{{?RFC1421}}. Combining the two yields the key management advantages of asymmetric
cryptography and the performance benefits of symmetric cryptography. The traditional
combination has been "encrypt the symmetric key with the public key." "Hybrid"
public key encryption (HPKE) schemes, specified here, take a different approach:
"generate the symmetric key and its encapsulation with the public key."
Specifically, encrypted messages convey an encryption key encapsulated with a
public key scheme, along with one or more arbitrary-sized ciphertexts encrypted
using that key. This type of public key encryption has many applications in
practice, including Messaging Layer Security {{?I-D.ietf-mls-protocol}} and
TLS Encrypted ClientHello {{?I-D.ietf-tls-esni}}.

Currently, there are numerous competing and non-interoperable standards and
variants for hybrid encryption, mostly variants on the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES), including ANSI X9.63
(ECIES) {{ANSI}}, IEEE 1363a {{IEEE1363}}, ISO/IEC 18033-2 {{ISO}}, and SECG SEC 1
{{SECG}}.  See {{MAEA10}} for a thorough comparison.  All these existing
schemes have problems, e.g., because they rely on outdated primitives, lack
proofs of indistinguishable (adaptive) chosen-ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) security, or fail to provide test vectors.

This document defines an HPKE scheme that provides a subset
of the functions provided by the collection of schemes above but
specified with sufficient clarity that they can be interoperably
implemented. The HPKE construction defined herein is secure against (adaptive)
chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2-secure) under classical assumptions about
the underlying primitives {{HPKEAnalysis}} {{ABHKLR20}}. A summary of
these analyses is in {{sec-properties}}.

# Requirements Notation

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Notation

The following terms are used throughout this document to describe the
operations, roles, and behaviors of HPKE:

- `(skX, pkX)`: A key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) key pair used in role X,
  where X is one of S, R, or E as sender, recipient, and ephemeral, respectively;
  `skX` is the private key and `pkX` is the public key.
- `pk(skX)`: The KEM public key corresponding to the KEM private key `skX`.
- Sender (S): Role of entity that sends an encrypted message.
- Recipient (R): Role of entity that receives an encrypted message.
- Ephemeral (E): Role of a fresh random value meant for one-time use.
- `I2OSP(n, w)`: Convert non-negative integer `n` to a `w`-length,
  big-endian byte string, as described in {{!RFC8017}}.
- `OS2IP(x)`: Convert byte string `x` to a non-negative integer, as
  described in {{!RFC8017}}, assuming big-endian byte order.
- `concat(x0, ..., xN)`: Concatenation of byte strings.
  `concat(0x01, 0x0203, 0x040506) = 0x010203040506`.
- `lengthPrefixed(x)`: The two-byte length of the byte string `x`, concatenated
  with `x` itself.  (`lengthPrefixed(x) = concat(I2OSP(len(x), 2), x)`)  It is
  an error to call this function with an `x` value that is more than 65535 bytes
  long.
- `random(n)`: A pseudorandom byte string of length `n` bytes
- `xor(a,b)`: XOR of byte strings; `xor(0xF0F0, 0x1234) = 0xE2C4`.
  It is an error to call this function with two arguments of unequal
  length.

# Cryptographic Dependencies {#base-crypto}

HPKE variants rely on the following primitives:

* A key encapsulation mechanism (KEM):
  - `GenerateKeyPair()`: Randomized algorithm to generate a key pair `(skX, pkX)`.
  - `DeriveKeyPair(ikm)`: Deterministic algorithm to derive a key pair
    `(skX, pkX)` from the byte string `ikm`, where `ikm` is an arbitrary-length
    byte string which SHOULD have at least `Nsk` bytes of entropy.
  - `SerializePublicKey(pkX)`: Produce a byte string of length `Npk` encoding the
    public key `pkX`.
  - `DeserializePublicKey(pkXm)`: Parse a byte string of length `Npk` to recover a
    public key. This function can raise a `DeserializeError` error upon `pkXm`
    deserialization failure.
  - `Encap(pkR)`: Randomized algorithm to generate an ephemeral,
    fixed-length symmetric key (the KEM shared secret) and
    a fixed-length encapsulation of that key that can be decapsulated
    by the holder of the private key corresponding to `pkR`. This function
    can raise an `EncapError` on encapsulation failure.
  - `Decap(enc, skR)`: Deterministic algorithm using the private key `skR`
    to recover the ephemeral symmetric key (the KEM shared secret) from
    its encapsulated representation `enc`. This function can raise a
    `DecapError` on decapsulation failure.
  - `Nsecret`: The length in bytes of a KEM shared secret produced by this KEM.
  - `Nenc`: The length in bytes of an encapsulated key produced by this KEM.
  - `Npk`: The length in bytes of an encoded public key for this KEM.
  - `Nsk`: The length in bytes of an encoded private key for this KEM.

* A key derivation function (KDF) of one of the two following forms:

  * A one-stage KDF:
    - `Derive(ikm, L)`: Derive an `L`-byte value from the input keying material
      `ikm`.
    - `Nh` The security strength of the KDF, in bytes.

  * A two-stage KDF:
    - `Extract(salt, ikm)`: Extract a pseudorandom key of fixed length `Nh` bytes
      from input keying material `ikm` and an optional byte string
      `salt`.
    - `Expand(prk, info, L)`: Expand a pseudorandom key `prk` using
      optional string `info` into `L` bytes of output keying material.
    - `Nh`: The output size of the `Extract()` function in bytes.

* An AEAD encryption algorithm {{!RFC5116}}:
  - `Seal(key, nonce, aad, pt)`: Encrypt and authenticate plaintext
    `pt` with associated data `aad` using symmetric key `key` and nonce
    `nonce`, yielding ciphertext and tag `ct`. This function
     can raise a `MessageLimitReachedError` upon failure.
  - `Open(key, nonce, aad, ct)`: Decrypt ciphertext and tag `ct` using
    associated data `aad` with symmetric key `key` and nonce `nonce`,
    returning plaintext message `pt`. This function can raise an
    `OpenError` or `MessageLimitReachedError` upon failure.
  - `Nk`: The length in bytes of a key for this algorithm.
  - `Nn`: The length in bytes of a nonce for this algorithm.
  - `Nt`: The length in bytes of the authentication tag for this algorithm.

Beyond the above, a KEM MAY also expose the following functions, whose behavior
is detailed in {{serializeprivatekey}}:

- `SerializePrivateKey(skX)`: Produce a byte string of length `Nsk` encoding the private
  key `skX`.
- `DeserializePrivateKey(skXm)`: Parse a byte string of length `Nsk` to recover a
  private key. This function can raise a `DeserializeError` error upon `skXm`
  deserialization failure.

A _ciphersuite_ is a triple (KEM, KDF, AEAD) containing a choice of algorithm
for each primitive.

A set of algorithm identifiers for concrete instantiations of these
primitives is provided in {{ciphersuites}}.  Algorithm identifier
values are two bytes long.

The notation `pk(skX)`, depending on its use and the KEM and its
implementation, is either the
computation of the public key using the private key, or just syntax
expressing the retrieval of the public key, assuming it is stored along
with the private key object.

The following functions are defined to facilitate domain separation of
KDF calls as well as context binding:

~~~
# For use with one-stage KDFs
def LabeledDerive(ikm, label, context, L):
  labeled_ikm = concat(
    ikm,
    "HPKE-v1",
    suite_id,
    lengthPrefixed(label),
    I2OSP(L, 2)
    context,
  )
  return Derive(labeled_ikm, L)
~~~

~~~
# For use with two-stage KDFs
def LabeledExtract(salt, label, ikm):
  labeled_ikm = concat("HPKE-v1", suite_id, label, ikm)
  return Extract(salt, labeled_ikm)

def LabeledExpand(prk, label, info, L):
  labeled_info = concat(I2OSP(L, 2), "HPKE-v1", suite_id,
                        label, info)
  return Expand(prk, labeled_info, L)
~~~

The value of `suite_id` depends on where the KDF is used; it is assumed
implicit from the implementation and not passed as a parameter. If used
inside a KEM algorithm, `suite_id` MUST start with "KEM" and identify
this KEM algorithm; if used in the remainder of HPKE, it MUST start with
"HPKE" and identify the entire ciphersuite in use. See sections {{dhkem}}
and {{encryption-context}} for details.

Certain functions have a different structure depending on whether a one-stage or
two-stage KDF is being used.  For clarity, such functions will be described
twice in this document, once with the suffix `_OneStage` and once with the
suffix `_TwoStage`, representing the versions of the function to be used with a
one-stage or two-stage KDF, respectively.  For example, the `Foo` function would
be invoked by calling `Foo_OneStage` when using a one-stage KDF, and by calling
`Foo_TwoStage` when using a two-stage KDF.

## DH-Based KEM (DHKEM) {#dhkem}

Suppose we are given a KDF, and a Diffie-Hellman (DH) group providing the
following operations:

- `DH(skX, pkY)`: Perform a non-interactive Diffie-Hellman exchange using
  the private key `skX` and public key `pkY` to produce a Diffie-Hellman shared
  secret of length `Ndh`. This function can raise a `ValidationError` as described
  in {{validation}}.
- `Ndh`: The length in bytes of a Diffie-Hellman shared secret produced
  by `DH()`.
- `Nsk`: The length in bytes of a Diffie-Hellman private key.

Then we can construct a KEM that implements the interface defined in {{base-crypto}}
called `DHKEM(Group, KDF)` in the following way, where `Group` denotes the
Diffie-Hellman group and `KDF` denotes the KDF. The function parameters `pkR` and `pkS`
are deserialized public keys, and `enc` is a serialized public key. Since
encapsulated keys are Diffie-Hellman public keys in this KEM algorithm,
we use `SerializePublicKey()` and `DeserializePublicKey()` to encode and decode
them, respectively. `Npk` equals `Nenc`. `GenerateKeyPair()` produces a key pair
for the Diffie-Hellman group in use. {{derive-key-pair}} contains the
`DeriveKeyPair()` function specification for DHKEMs defined in this document.

~~~
# For use with one-stage KDFs
def ExtractAndExpand_OneStage(dh, kem_context):
  return LabeledDerive(dh, "shared_secret", kem_context, Nsecret)

# For use with two-stage KDFs
def ExtractAndExpand_TwoStage(dh, kem_context):
  eae_prk = LabeledExtract("", "eae_prk", dh)
  shared_secret = LabeledExpand(eae_prk, "shared_secret",
                                kem_context, Nsecret)
  return shared_secret

def Encap(pkR):
  skE, pkE = GenerateKeyPair()
  dh = DH(skE, pkR)
  enc = SerializePublicKey(pkE)

  pkRm = SerializePublicKey(pkR)
  kem_context = concat(enc, pkRm)

  shared_secret = ExtractAndExpand(dh, kem_context)
  return shared_secret, enc

def Decap(enc, skR):
  pkE = DeserializePublicKey(enc)
  dh = DH(skR, pkE)

  pkRm = SerializePublicKey(pk(skR))
  kem_context = concat(enc, pkRm)

  shared_secret = ExtractAndExpand(dh, kem_context)
  return shared_secret
~~~

The implicit `suite_id` value used within `LabeledExtract`, `LabeledExpand`, and
`LabeledDerive` is defined as follows, where `kem_id` is defined in {{kem-ids}}:

~~~
suite_id = concat("KEM", I2OSP(kem_id, 2))
~~~

The KDF used in DHKEM can be equal to or different from the KDF used
in the remainder of HPKE, depending on the chosen variant.
Implementations MUST make sure to use the constants (`Nh`) and function
calls (`LabeledExtract`, `LabeledExpand`, and `LabeledDerive`) of the appropriate KDF when
implementing DHKEM. See {{kdf-choice}} for a comment on the choice of
a KDF for the remainder of HPKE, and {{domain-separation}} for the
rationale of the labels.

For the variants of DHKEM defined in this document, the size `Nsecret` of the
KEM shared secret is equal to the output length of the hash function
underlying the KDF. For P-256, P-384, and P-521, the size `Ndh` of the
Diffie-Hellman shared secret is equal to 32, 48, and 66, respectively,
corresponding to the x-coordinate of the resulting elliptic curve point {{IEEE1363}}.
For X25519 and X448, the size `Ndh` is equal to 32 and 56, respectively
(see {{?RFC7748}}, Section 5).

Senders and recipients MUST validate KEM inputs and outputs as described
in {{kem-ids}}.

# Hybrid Public Key Encryption {#hpke}

In this section, we define a few HPKE variants.  All variants take a
recipient public key and a sequence of plaintexts `pt` and produce an
encapsulated key `enc` and a sequence of ciphertexts `ct`.  These outputs are
constructed so that only the holder of `skR` can decapsulate the key from
`enc` and decrypt the ciphertexts.  All the algorithms also take an
`info` parameter that can be used to influence the generation of keys
(e.g., to fold in identity information) and an `aad` parameter that
provides additional authenticated data to the AEAD algorithm in use.

In addition to the base case of encrypting to a public key, we include a variant
that authenticates possession of a pre-shared key. The authenticated variant
contributes additional keying material to the encryption operation. The
following one-byte values will be used to distinguish between modes:

| Mode          | Value |
|:==============|:======|
| mode_base     | 0x00  |
| mode_psk      | 0x01  |
| RESERVED      | 0x02  |
| RESERVED      | 0x03  |
{: #hpke-modes title="HPKE Modes"}

(The values 0x02 and 0x03 were used in {{RFC9180}} to reflect additional
variants which have been removed from this specification.)

Both variants follow the same basic two-step pattern:

1. Set up an encryption context that is shared between the sender
   and the recipient.
2. Use that context to encrypt or decrypt content.

A _context_ is an implementation-specific structure that encodes
the AEAD algorithm and key in use, and manages the nonces used so
that the same nonce is not used with multiple plaintexts. It also
has an interface for exporting secret values, as described in
{{hpke-export}}. See {{hpke-dem}} for a description of this structure
and its interfaces. HPKE decryption fails when the underlying AEAD
decryption fails.

The constructions described here presume that the relevant non-private
parameters (`enc`, `psk_id`, etc.) are transported between the sender and the
recipient by some application making use of HPKE. Moreover, a recipient with more
than one public key needs some way of determining which of its public keys was
used for the encapsulation operation. As an example, applications may send this
information alongside a ciphertext from the sender to the recipient. Specification of
such a mechanism is left to the application. See {{message-encoding}} for more
details.

The procedures described in this section are laid out in a
Python-like pseudocode. The algorithms in use are left implicit.

## Creating the Encryption Context {#encryption-context}

The variants of HPKE defined in this document share a common
key schedule that translates the protocol inputs into an encryption
context. The key schedule inputs are as follows:

* `mode` - A one-byte value indicating the HPKE mode, defined in {{hpke-modes}}.
* `shared_secret` - A KEM shared secret generated for this transaction.
* `info` - Application-supplied information (optional; default value
  "").
* `psk` - A pre-shared key (PSK) held by both the sender
  and the recipient (optional; default value "").
* `psk_id` - An identifier for the PSK (optional; default value "").

Senders and recipients MUST validate KEM inputs and outputs as described
in {{kem-ids}}.

The `info` parameter used by HPKE is not related to the optional string `info`
used by the `LabeledExpand()` or `Expand()` functions detailed in {{base-crypto}}.

The `psk` and `psk_id` parameters MUST appear together or not at all.
That is, if a non-default value is provided for one of them, then
the other MUST be set to a non-default value. This requirement is
encoded in `VerifyPSKInputs()` below.

The `psk`, `psk_id`, and `info` parameters have maximum lengths that depend
on the KDF itself, on the definition of `LabeledExtract()`, and on the
constant labels used together with them. See {{kdf-input-length}} for
precise limits on these lengths.

The `key`, `base_nonce`, and `exporter_secret` computed by the key schedule
have the property that they are only known to the holder of the recipient
private key, and the entity that used the KEM to generate `shared_secret` and
`enc`.

The HPKE algorithm identifiers, i.e., the KEM `kem_id`, KDF `kdf_id`, and
AEAD `aead_id` 2-byte code points, as defined in {{kemid-values}}, {{kdfid-values}},
and {{aeadid-values}}, respectively, are assumed implicit from the implementation
and not passed as parameters. The implicit `suite_id` value used within
`LabeledExtract`, `LabeledExpand`, and `LabeledDerive` is defined based on them as follows:

~~~
suite_id = concat(
  "HPKE",
  I2OSP(kem_id, 2),
  I2OSP(kdf_id, 2),
  I2OSP(aead_id, 2)

The `ROLE` template parameter is either S or R, depending on the role
of sender or recipient, respectively. The third parameter in the
`Context<ROLE>` refers to the sequence number, that is initialised with
a 0 value. See {{hpke-dem}} for a discussion of the key schedule output,
including the role-specific Context structure and its API, and the
usage of the sequence number.

Note that the `key_schedule_context` construction in `KeySchedule()` is
equivalent to serializing a structure of the following form in the TLS presentation
syntax:

~~~~~
struct {
    uint8 mode;
    opaque psk_id_hash[Nh];
    opaque info_hash[Nh];
} KeyScheduleContext;
~~~~~

### Encryption to a Public Key {#hpke-kem}

The most basic function of an HPKE scheme is to enable encryption
to the holder of a given KEM private key.  The `SetupBaseS()` and
`SetupBaseR()` procedures establish contexts that can be used to
encrypt and decrypt, respectively, for a given private key.

The KEM shared secret is combined via the KDF
with information describing the key exchange, as well as the
explicit `info` parameter provided by the caller.

The parameter `pkR` is a public key, and `enc` is an encapsulated
KEM shared secret.

~~~~~
def SetupBaseS(pkR, info):
  shared_secret, enc = Encap(pkR)
  return enc, KeyScheduleS(mode_base, shared_secret, info,
                           default_psk, default_psk_id)

def SetupBaseR(enc, skR, info):
  shared_secret = Decap(enc, skR)
  return KeyScheduleR(mode_base, shared_secret, info,
                      default_psk, default_psk_id)
~~~~~

### Authentication Using a Pre-Shared Key {#mode-psk}

This variant extends the base mechanism by allowing the recipient to
authenticate that the sender possessed a given PSK. The PSK also
improves confidentiality guarantees in certain adversary models, as
described in more detail in {{sec-properties}}. We assume that both
parties have been provisioned with both the PSK value `psk` and another
byte string `psk_id` that is used to identify which PSK should be used.

The primary difference from the base case is that the `psk` and `psk_id` values
are used as `ikm` inputs to the KDF (instead of using the empty string).

The PSK MUST have at least 32 bytes of entropy and SHOULD be of length `Nh`
bytes or longer. See {{security-psk}} for a more detailed discussion.

~~~~~
def SetupPSKS(pkR, info, psk, psk_id):
  shared_secret, enc = Encap(pkR)
  return enc, KeyScheduleS(mode_psk, shared_secret, info, psk, psk_id)

def SetupPSKR(enc, skR, info, psk, psk_id):
  shared_secret = Decap(enc, skR)
  return KeyScheduleR(mode_psk, shared_secret, info, psk, psk_id)
~~~~~

## Encryption and Decryption {#hpke-dem}

HPKE allows multiple encryption operations to be done based on a
given setup transaction.  Since the public key operations involved
in setup are typically more expensive than symmetric encryption or
decryption, this allows applications to amortize the cost of the
public key operations, reducing the overall overhead.

In order to avoid nonce reuse, however, this encryption must be
stateful. Each of the setup procedures above produces a role-specific
context object that stores the AEAD and secret export parameters.
The AEAD parameters consist of:

* The AEAD algorithm in use
* A secret `key`
* A base nonce `base_nonce`
* A sequence number (initially 0)

The secret export parameters consist of:

* The HPKE ciphersuite in use and
* An `exporter_secret` used for the secret export interface (see
  {{hpke-export}})

All these parameters except the AEAD sequence number are constant.
The sequence number provides nonce uniqueness: The nonce used for
each encryption or decryption operation is the result of XORing
`base_nonce` with the current sequence number, encoded as a big-endian
integer of the same length as `base_nonce`. Implementations MAY use a
sequence number that is shorter than the nonce length (padding on the left
with zero), but MUST raise an error if the sequence number overflows. The AEAD
algorithm produces ciphertext that is Nt bytes longer than the plaintext.
Nt = 16 for AEAD algorithms defined in this document.

Encryption is unidirectional from sender to recipient. The sender's
context can encrypt a plaintext `pt` with associated data `aad` as
follows:

~~~~~
def ContextS.Seal(aad, pt):
  ct = Seal(self.key, self.ComputeNonce(self.seq), aad, pt)
  self.IncrementSeq()
  return ct
~~~~~

The recipient's context can decrypt a ciphertext `ct` with associated
data `aad` as follows:

~~~~~
def ContextR.Open(aad, ct):
  pt = Open(self.key, self.ComputeNonce(self.seq), aad, ct)
  if pt == OpenError:
    raise OpenError
  self.IncrementSeq()
  return pt
~~~~~

Each encryption or decryption operation increments the sequence number for
the context in use. The per-message nonce and sequence number increment
details are as follows:

~~~~~
def Context<ROLE>.ComputeNonce(seq):
  seq_bytes = I2OSP(seq, Nn)
  return xor(self.base_nonce, seq_bytes)

def Context<ROLE>.IncrementSeq():
  if self.seq >= (1 << (8*Nn)) - 1:
    raise MessageLimitReachedError
  self.seq += 1
~~~~~

The sender's context MUST NOT be used for decryption. Similarly, the recipient's
context MUST NOT be used for encryption. Higher-level protocols reusing the HPKE
key exchange for more general purposes can derive separate keying material as
needed using use the secret export interface; see {{hpke-export}} and {{bidirectional}}
for more details.

It is up to the application to ensure that encryptions and decryptions are
done in the proper sequence, so that encryption and decryption nonces align.
If `ContextS.Seal()` or `ContextR.Open()` would cause the `seq` parameter to
overflow, then the implementation MUST fail with an error. (In the pseudocode
above, `Context<ROLE>.IncrementSeq()` fails with an error when `seq` overflows,
which causes `ContextS.Seal()` and `ContextR.Open()` to fail accordingly.)
Note that the internal `Seal()` and `Open()` calls inside correspond to the
context's AEAD algorithm.

## Secret Export {#hpke-export}

HPKE provides an interface for exporting secrets from the encryption context
using a variable-length pseudorandom function (PRF), similar to the TLS 1.3 exporter interface
(see {{?RFC8446}}, Section 7.5). This interface takes as input a context
string `exporter_context` and a desired length `L` in bytes, and produces
a secret derived from the internal exporter secret using the corresponding
KDF Expand function. For the KDFs defined in this specification, `L` has
a maximum value of `255*Nh`. Future specifications that define new KDFs
MUST specify a bound for `L`.

The `exporter_context` parameter has a maximum length that depends on the KDF
itself, on the definition of `LabeledExpand()`, and on the constant labels
used together with them. See {{kdf-input-length}} for precise limits on this
length.

~~~~~
# For use with a one-stage KDF
def Context.Export_OneStage(exporter_context, L):
  return LabeledDerive(self.exporter_secret, "sec",
                       exporter_context, L)

# For use with a two-stage KDF
def Context.Export_TwoStage(exporter_context, L):
  return LabeledExpand(self.exporter_secret, "sec",
                       exporter_context, L)
~~~~~

Applications that do not use the encryption API in {{hpke-dem}} can use
the export-only AEAD ID `0xFFFF` when computing the key schedule. Such
applications can avoid computing the `key` and `base_nonce` values in the
key schedule, as they are not used by the Export interface described above.

# Single-Shot APIs {#single-shot-apis}

## Encryption and Decryption {#single-shot-encryption}

In many cases, applications encrypt only a single message to a recipient's
public key.  This section provides templates for HPKE APIs that implement
stateless "single-shot" encryption and decryption using APIs specified in
{{encryption-context}} and {{hpke-dem}}:

~~~~~
def Seal<MODE>(pkR, info, aad, pt, ...):
  enc, ctx = Setup<MODE>S(pkR, info, ...)
  ct = ctx.Seal(aad, pt)
  return enc, ct

def Open<MODE>(enc, skR, info, aad, ct, ...):
  ctx = Setup<MODE>R(enc, skR, info, ...)
  return ctx.Open(aad, ct)
~~~~~

The `MODE` template parameter is either Base or PSK. The optional parameters
indicated by "..." depend on `MODE` and may be empty. For example, `SetupBase()` has no
additional parameters. `SealPSK()` and `OpenPSK()` would be implemented as follows:

~~~
def SealPSK(pkR, info, aad, pt, psk, psk_id):
  enc, ctx = SetupPSKS(pkR, info, psk, psk_id)
  ct = ctx.Seal(aad, pt)
  return enc, ct

def OpenPSK(enc, skR, info, aad, ct, psk, psk_id):
  ctx = SetupPSKR(enc, skR, info, psk, psk_id)
  return ctx.Open(aad, ct)
~~~

## Secret Export

Applications may also want to derive a secret known only to a given recipient.
This section provides templates for HPKE APIs that implement stateless
"single-shot" secret export using APIs specified in {{hpke-export}}:

~~~
def SendExport<MODE>(pkR, info, exporter_context, L, ...):
  enc, ctx = Setup<MODE>S(pkR, info, ...)
  exported = ctx.Export(exporter_context, L)
  return enc, exported

def ReceiveExport<MODE>(enc, skR, info, exporter_context, L, ...):
  ctx = Setup<MODE>R(enc, skR, info, ...)
  return ctx.Export(exporter_context, L)
~~~

As in {{single-shot-encryption}}, the `MODE` template parameter is either Base or PSK.
The optional parameters indicated by "..." depend on `MODE` and may be empty.

# Algorithm Identifiers {#ciphersuites}

This section lists algorithm identifiers suitable for different HPKE configurations.
Future specifications may introduce new KEM, KDF, and AEAD algorithm identifiers
and retain the security guarantees presented in this document provided they adhere
to the security requirements in {{kem-security}}, {{kdf-choice}}, and {{aead-security}},
respectively.

## Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) {#kem-ids}

{: #kemid-values title="KEM IDs"}

The `Auth` column indicates if the KEM algorithm provides the `AuthEncap()`/`AuthDecap()`
interface defined in {{?RFC9180}}.

### SerializePublicKey and DeserializePublicKey

For P-256, P-384, and P-521, the `SerializePublicKey()` function of the
KEM performs the uncompressed Elliptic-Curve-Point-to-Octet-String
conversion according to {{SECG}}. `DeserializePublicKey()` performs the
uncompressed Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-Point conversion.

For X25519 and X448, the `SerializePublicKey()` and `DeserializePublicKey()`
functions are the identity function, since these curves already use
fixed-length byte strings for public keys.

Some deserialized public keys MUST be validated before they can be used. See
{{validation}} for specifics.

### SerializePrivateKey and DeserializePrivateKey {#serializeprivatekey}

As per {{SECG}}, P-256, P-384, and P-521 private keys are field elements in the
scalar field of the curve being used. For this section, and for
{{derive-key-pair}}, it is assumed that implementors of ECDH over these curves
use an integer representation of private keys that is compatible with the
`OS2IP()` function.

For P-256, P-384, and P-521, the `SerializePrivateKey()` function of the KEM
performs the Field-Element-to-Octet-String conversion according to {{SECG}}. If
the private key is an integer outside the range `[0, order-1]`, where `order`
is the order of the curve being used, the private key MUST be reduced to its
representative in `[0, order-1]` before being serialized.
`DeserializePrivateKey()` performs the Octet-String-to-Field-Element conversion
according to {{SECG}}.

For X25519 and X448, private keys are identical to their byte string
representation, so little processing has to be done. The
`SerializePrivateKey()` function MUST clamp its output and the
`DeserializePrivateKey()` function MUST clamp its input, where _clamping_ refers to the
bitwise operations performed on `k` in the `decodeScalar25519()` and
`decodeScalar448()` functions defined in Section 5 of {{?RFC7748}}.

To catch invalid keys early on, implementors of DHKEMs SHOULD check that
deserialized private keys are not equivalent to 0 (mod `order`), where `order`
is the order of the DH group. Note that this property is trivially true for X25519
and X448 groups, since clamped values can never be 0 (mod `order`).

### DeriveKeyPair {#derive-key-pair}

The keys that `DeriveKeyPair()` produces have only as much entropy as the provided
input keying material. For a given KEM, the `ikm` parameter given to `DeriveKeyPair()` SHOULD
have length at least `Nsk`, and SHOULD have at least `Nsk` bytes of entropy.

All invocations of KDF functions (such as `LabeledExtract` or `LabeledExpand`) in any
DHKEM's `DeriveKeyPair()` function use the DHKEM's associated KDF (as opposed to
the ciphersuite's KDF).

For P-256, P-384, and P-521, the `DeriveKeyPair()` function of the KEM performs
rejection sampling over field elements:

~~~
# For use with a one-stage KDF
def DeriveCandidate_OneStage(ikm, counter):
  return LabeledDerive(ikm, "candidate", I2OSP(counter, 1), Nsk)

# For use with a two-stage KDF
def DeriveCandidate_TwoStage(ikm, counter):
  # Note: dkp_prk may be derived once and cached
  dkp_prk = LabeledExtract("", "dkp_prk", ikm)
  return LabeledExpand(dkp_prk, "candidate",
                          I2OSP(counter, 1), Nsk)

def DeriveKeyPair(ikm):
  sk = 0
  counter = 0
  while sk == 0 or sk >= order:
    if counter > 255:
      raise DeriveKeyPairError
    bytes = DeriveCandidate(ikm, counter)
    bytes[0] = bytes[0] & bitmask
    sk = OS2IP(bytes)
    counter = counter + 1
  return (sk, pk(sk))
~~~

`order` is the order of the curve being used (see Section D.1.2 of {{NISTCurves}}), and
is listed below for completeness.

~~~~~
P-256:
0xffffffff00000000ffffffffffffffffbce6faada7179e84f3b9cac2fc632551

P-384:
0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffc7634d81f4372ddf
  581a0db248b0a77aecec196accc52973

P-521:
0x01ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
  fa51868783bf2f966b7fcc0148f709a5d03bb5c9b8899c47aebb6fb71e91386409
~~~~~

`bitmask` is defined to be 0xFF for P-256 and P-384, and 0x01 for P-521.
The precise likelihood of `DeriveKeyPair()` failing with DeriveKeyPairError
depends on the group being used, but it is negligibly small in all cases.
See {{api-errors}} for information about dealing with such failures.

For X25519 and X448, the `DeriveKeyPair()` function applies a KDF to the input:

~~~
# For use with a one-stage KDF
def DeriveKeyPair_OneStage(ikm):
  sk = LabeledDerive(ikm, "sk", "", Nsk)
  return (sk, pk(sk))

# For use with a two-stage KDF
def DeriveKeyPair_TwoStage(ikm):
  dkp_prk = LabeledExtract("", "dkp_prk", ikm)
  sk = LabeledExpand(dkp_prk, "sk", "", Nsk)
  return (sk, pk(sk))
~~~

The `suite_id` used implicitly in `LabeledExtract()` and `LabeledExpand()`
for `DeriveKeyPair(ikm)` is derived from the KEM identifier of the
DHKEM in use (see {{kem-ids}}), that is, based on the type of key
pair been generated for that DHKEM type.

### Validation of Inputs and Outputs {#validation}

The following public keys are subject to validation if the group
requires public key validation: the sender MUST validate the recipient's
public key `pkR`; the recipient MUST validate the ephemeral public key
`pkE`. Validation failure yields a `ValidationError`.

For P-256, P-384 and P-521, senders and recipients MUST perform partial
public key validation on all public key inputs, as defined in Section 5.6.2.3.4
of {{keyagreement}}. This includes checking that the coordinates are in the
correct range, that the point is on the curve, and that the point is not the
point at infinity. Additionally, senders and recipients MUST ensure the
Diffie-Hellman shared secret is not the point at infinity.

For X25519 and X448, public keys and Diffie-Hellman outputs MUST be validated
as described in {{?RFC7748}}. In particular, recipients MUST check whether
the Diffie-Hellman shared secret is the all-zero value and abort if so.

### Future KEMs {#future-kems}

{{kem-security}} lists security requirements on a KEM used within HPKE.

A KEM algorithm may support different encoding algorithms, with different output
lengths, for KEM public keys. Such KEM algorithms MUST specify only one encoding
algorithm whose output length is `Npk`.

## Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) {#kdf-ids}

{: #kdfid-values title="KDF IDs"}

### Input Length Restrictions {#kdf-input-length}

For one-stage KDFs, there is length limit of 65,535 bytes for the `psk`,
`psk_id`, `info` fields. This limitation arises because these fields are all
prefixed with a two-byte length when being used as KDF inputs. There is no
inherent length limitation on `exporter_context`.  If a one-stage KDF has an
input length limit, then implementations MUST limit the length of
`exporter_context` accordingly, so that the `LabeledDerive` call in
`Context.Export` does not overflow the input length limit.

For two-stage KDFs, this document defines `LabeledExtract()` and `LabeledExpand()` based on the
KDFs listed above. These functions add prefixes to their respective
inputs `ikm` and `info` before calling the KDF's `Extract()` and `Expand()`
functions. This leads to a reduction of the maximum input length that
is available for the inputs `psk`, `psk_id`, `info`, `exporter_context`,
`ikm`, i.e., the variable-length parameters provided by HPKE applications.
The following table lists the maximum allowed lengths of these parameters
for the KDFs defined in this document, as inclusive bounds in bytes:

| Input               | HKDF-SHA256  | HKDF-SHA384   | HKDF-SHA512   |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| psk                 | 2^{61} - 88  | 2^{125} - 152 | 2^{125} - 152 |
| psk_id              | 2^{61} - 93  | 2^{125} - 157 | 2^{125} - 157 |
| info                | 2^{61} - 91  | 2^{125} - 155 | 2^{125} - 155 |
| exporter_context    | 2^{61} - 120 | 2^{125} - 200 | 2^{125} - 216 |
| ikm (DeriveKeyPair) | 2^{61} - 84  | 2^{125} - 148 | 2^{125} - 148 |
{: #input-limits title="Application Input Limits"}

This shows that the limits are only marginally smaller than the maximum
input length of the underlying hash function; these limits are large and
unlikely to be reached in practical applications. Future specifications
that define new KDFs MUST specify bounds for these variable-length
parameters.

Since the above bounds are larger than any values used in practice, it may be
useful for implementations to impose a lower limit on the values they will
accept (for example, to avoid dynamic allocations).  Implementations SHOULD set
such a limit to be no less than maximum `Nsk` size for a KEM supported by the
implementation.  For an implementation that supports all of the KEMs in this
document, the limit would be 66 bytes, which is the `Nsk` value for DHKEM(P-521,
HKDF-SHA512).

The values for `psk`, `psk_id`, `info`, and `ikm`, which are inputs to
`LabeledExtract()`, were computed with the following expression:

~~~
max_size_hash_input - Nb - size_version_label -
    size_suite_id - size_input_label
~~~

The value for `exporter_context`, which is an input to `LabeledExpand()`,
was computed with the following expression:

~~~
max_size_hash_input - Nb - Nh - size_version_label -
    size_suite_id - size_input_label - 2 - 1
~~~

In these equations, `max_size_hash_input` is the maximum input length
of the underlying hash function in bytes, `Nb` is the block size of the
underlying hash function in bytes, `size_version_label` is the size
of "HPKE-v1" in bytes and equals 7, `size_suite_id` is the size of the
`suite_id` in bytes and equals 5 for DHKEM (relevant for `ikm`) and 10 for the
remainder of HPKE (relevant for `psk`, `psk_id`, `info`, and `exporter_context`),
and `size_input_label` is the size in bytes of the label used as parameter to
`LabeledExtract()` or `LabeledExpand()`, the maximum of which is 13
across all labels in this document.

# API Considerations {#api-considerations}

This section documents considerations for interfaces to implementations of HPKE.
This includes error handling considerations and recommendations that improve
interoperability when HPKE is used in applications.

## Auxiliary Authenticated Application Information

HPKE has two places at which applications can specify auxiliary authenticated information:
(1) during context construction via the Setup `info` parameter, and (2) during Context
operations, i.e., with the `aad` parameter for `Open()` and `Seal()`, and the `exporter_context` parameter
for `Export()`. Application information applicable to multiple operations on a single Context
should use the Setup `info` parameter. This avoids redundantly processing this information for
each Context operation. In contrast, application information that varies on a per-message basis
should be specified via the Context APIs (`Seal()`, `Open()`, or `Export()`).

Applications that only use the single-shot APIs described in {{single-shot-apis}} should use the
Setup `info` parameter for specifying auxiliary authenticated information. Implementations which
only expose single-shot APIs should not allow applications to use both Setup `info` and Context
`aad` or `exporter_context` auxiliary information parameters.

## Errors {#api-errors}

The high-level, public HPKE APIs specified in this document are all fallible.
These include the Setup functions and all encryption context functions.
For example, `Decap()` can fail if the encapsulated key `enc` is invalid,
and `Open()` may fail if ciphertext decryption fails. The explicit errors
generated throughout this specification, along with the conditions that
lead to each error, are as follows:

- `ValidationError`: KEM input or output validation failure; {{dhkem}}.
- `DeserializeError`: Public or private key deserialization failure; {{base-crypto}}.
- `EncapError`: `Encap()` failure; {{base-crypto}}.
- `DecapError`: `Decap()` failure; {{base-crypto}}.
- `OpenError`: Context AEAD `Open()` failure; {{base-crypto}} and {{hpke-dem}}.
- `MessageLimitReachedError`: Context AEAD sequence number overflow; {{base-crypto}} and {{hpke-dem}}.
- `DeriveKeyPairError`: Key pair derivation failure; {{derive-key-pair}}.

Implicit errors may also occur. As an example, certain classes of failures,
e.g., malformed recipient public keys, may not yield explicit errors.
For example, for the DHKEM variant described in this specification,
the `Encap()` algorithm fails when given an invalid recipient public key.
However, other KEM algorithms may not have an efficient algorithm for verifying
the validity of public keys. As a result, an equivalent error may not manifest
until AEAD decryption at the recipient.

The errors in this document are meant as a guide for implementors. They are not
an exhaustive list of all the errors an implementation might emit. For example,
future KEMs might have internal failure cases, or an implementation might run
out of memory.

How these errors are expressed in an API or handled by applications is an
implementation-specific detail. For example, some implementations may abort or
panic upon a `DeriveKeyPairError` failure given that it only occurs with
negligible probability, whereas other implementations may retry the failed
DeriveKeyPair operation. See {{derive-key-pair}} for more information.
As another example, some implementations of the DHKEM specified in this document
may choose to transform `ValidationError` from `DH()` into an `EncapError` or
`DecapError` from `Encap()` or `Decap()`, respectively, whereas others may choose
to raise `ValidationError` unmodified.

Applications using HPKE APIs should not assume that the errors here are complete,
nor should they assume certain classes of errors will always manifest the same way
for all ciphersuites. For example, the DHKEM specified in this document will emit
a `DeserializationError` or `ValidationError` if a KEM public key is invalid. However,
a new KEM might not have an efficient algorithm for determining whether or not a
public key is valid. In this case, an invalid public key might instead yield an
`OpenError` when trying to decrypt a ciphertext.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

## Security Properties {#sec-properties}

HPKE has several security goals, depending on the mode of operation,
against active and adaptive attackers that can compromise partial
secrets of senders and recipients. The desired security goals are
detailed below:

* Message secrecy: Confidentiality of the sender's messages against
  chosen ciphertext attacks
* Export key secrecy: Indistinguishability of each export
  secret from a uniformly random bitstring of equal length, i.e.,
  `Context.Export` is a variable-length PRF
* Sender authentication: Proof of sender origin for the PSK mode

These security goals are expected to hold for any honest sender and
honest recipient keys, as well as if the honest sender and honest
recipient keys are the same.

HPKE mitigates malleability problems (called benign malleability {{SECG}}) in prior
public key encryption standards based on ECIES by including all public keys in the
context of the key schedule.

HPKE does not provide forward secrecy with respect to recipient compromise.
In the Base mode, the secrecy properties are only expected to
hold if the recipient private key `skR` is not compromised at any point
in time. In the PSK mode, the secrecy properties are
expected to hold if the recipient private key `skR` and the pre-shared key
are not both compromised at any point in time. See {{non-goals}} for more
details.

Besides forward secrecy and key-compromise impersonation, which are highlighted
in this section because of their particular cryptographic importance, HPKE
has other non-goals that are described in {{non-goals}}: no tolerance of
message reordering or loss, no downgrade or replay prevention, no hiding of the
plaintext length, and no protection against bad ephemeral randomness. {{non-goals}}
suggests application-level mitigations for some of them.

### Computational Analysis

It is shown in {{CS01}} that a hybrid public key encryption scheme of
essentially the same form as the Base mode described here is
IND-CCA2-secure as long as the underlying KEM and AEAD schemes are
IND-CCA2-secure. Moreover, it is shown in {{HHK06}} that IND-CCA2 security
of the KEM and the data encapsulation mechanism are necessary conditions
to achieve IND-CCA2 security for hybrid public key encryption.
The main difference between the scheme proposed in {{CS01}}
and the Base mode in this document (both named HPKE) is that we interpose
some KDF calls between the KEM and the AEAD. Analyzing the HPKE Base mode
instantiation in this document therefore requires verifying that the
additional KDF calls do not cause the IND-CCA2 property to fail, as
well as verifying the additional export key secrecy property.

A preliminary computational analysis of all HPKE modes has been done
in {{HPKEAnalysis}}, indicating asymptotic security for the case where
the KEM is DHKEM, the AEAD is any IND-CPA-secure and INT-CTXT-secure scheme,
and the DH group and KDF satisfy the following conditions:

- DH group: The gap Diffie-Hellman (GDH) problem is hard in the
  appropriate subgroup {{GAP}}.
- `Extract()` and `Expand()`: `Extract()` can be modeled as a random oracle.
  `Expand()` can be modeled as a pseudorandom function, wherein the first
  argument is the key.

In particular, the KDFs and DH groups defined in this document (see
{{kdf-ids}} and {{kem-ids}}) satisfy these properties when used as
specified. The analysis in {{HPKEAnalysis}} demonstrates that under these
constraints, HPKE continues to provide IND-CCA2 security, and provides
the additional properties noted above. Also, the analysis confirms the
expected properties hold under the different key compromise cases
mentioned above. The analysis considers a sender that sends one message
using the encryption context, and additionally exports two independent
secrets using the secret export interface.

The table below summarizes the main results from {{HPKEAnalysis}}. N/A
means that a property does not apply for the given mode, whereas `Y` means
the given mode satisfies the property.

| Variant | Message Sec. | Export Sec. | Sender Auth. |
|:--------|:------------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| Base    | Y            | Y           | N/A          |
| PSK     | Y            | Y           | Y            |

If non-DH-based KEMs are to be used with HPKE, further analysis will be
necessary to prove their security. The results from {{CS01}} provide
some indication that any IND-CCA2-secure KEM will suffice here, but are
not conclusive given the differences in the schemes.

### Post-Quantum Security

All of {{CS01}}, {{HPKEAnalysis}}, and {{ABHKLR20}} are premised on
classical security models and assumptions, and do not consider
adversaries capable of quantum computation. A full proof of post-quantum
security would need to take appropriate security models and assumptions
into account, in addition to simply using a post-quantum KEM.

In future work, the analysis from {{ABHKLR20}} can be extended to cover
HPKE's other modes and desired security properties.
The hybrid quantum-resistance property described above, which is achieved
by using the PSK mode, is not proven in {{HPKEAnalysis}} because
this analysis requires the random oracle model; in a quantum
setting, this model needs adaption to, for example, the quantum random
oracle model.

## Security Requirements on a KEM Used within HPKE {#kem-security}

A KEM used within HPKE MUST allow HPKE to satisfy its desired security
properties described in {{sec-properties}}. {{domain-separation}} lists
requirements concerning domain separation.

In particular, the KEM
shared secret MUST be a uniformly random byte string of length `Nsecret`.
This means, for instance, that it would not be sufficient if the KEM
shared secret is only uniformly random as an element of some set prior
to its encoding as a byte string.

### Encap/Decap Interface

As mentioned in {{sec-considerations}}, {{CS01}} provides some indications
that if the KEM's `Encap()`/`Decap()` interface (which is used in the Base
and PSK modes) is IND-CCA2-secure, HPKE is able to satisfy its desired
security properties. An appropriate definition of IND-CCA2 security for
KEMs can be found in {{CS01}} and {{BHK09}}.

### KEM Key Reuse

An `ikm` input to `DeriveKeyPair()` ({{derive-key-pair}}) MUST NOT be
reused elsewhere, in particular not with `DeriveKeyPair()` of a
different KEM.

Since a KEM key pair belonging to a sender or recipient works with all modes, it can
be used with multiple modes in parallel. HPKE is constructed to be
secure in such settings due to domain separation using the `suite_id`
variable. However, there is no formal proof of security at the time of
writing for using multiple modes in parallel; {{HPKEAnalysis}} and
{{ABHKLR20}} only analyze isolated modes.

## Security Requirements on a KDF {#kdf-choice}

The choice of the KDF for HPKE SHOULD be made based on the security
level provided by the KEM and, if applicable, by the PSK. The KDF
SHOULD at least have the security level of the KEM and SHOULD
at least have the security level provided by the PSK.

## Security Requirements on an AEAD {#aead-security}

All AEADs MUST be IND-CCA2-secure, as is currently true for all AEADs
listed in {{aead-ids}}.

## Pre-Shared Key Recommendations {#security-psk}

In the PSK modes, the PSK MUST have at least 32 bytes of
entropy and SHOULD be of length `Nh` bytes or longer. Using a PSK longer than
32 bytes but shorter than `Nh` bytes is permitted.

HPKE is specified to use HKDF as its key derivation function. HKDF is not
designed to slow down dictionary attacks (see {{?RFC5869}}). Thus, HPKE's
PSK mechanism is not suitable for use with a low-entropy password as the
PSK: In scenarios in which the adversary knows the KEM shared secret
`shared_secret` and has access to an oracle that distinguishes between
a good and a wrong PSK, it can perform PSK-recovering attacks. This oracle
can be the decryption operation on a captured HPKE ciphertext or any other
recipient behavior that is observably different when using a wrong PSK.
The adversary knows the KEM shared secret `shared_secret` if it knows all
KEM private keys of one participant. In the PSK mode, this is trivially
the case if the adversary acts as the sender.

To recover a lower entropy PSK, an attacker in this scenario can trivially
perform a dictionary attack. Given a set `S` of possible PSK values, the
attacker generates an HPKE ciphertext for each value in `S`, and submits
the resulting ciphertexts to the oracle to learn which PSK is being used by
the recipient. Further, because HPKE uses AEAD schemes that are not key-committing,
an attacker can mount a partitioning oracle attack {{LGR20}} that can recover
the PSK from a set of `S` possible PSK values, with |S| = m\*k, in roughly
m + log k queries to the oracle using ciphertexts of length proportional to
k, the maximum message length in blocks. (Applying the multi-collision algorithm from
{{LGR20}} requires a small adaptation to the algorithm wherein the appropriate nonce
is computed for each candidate key. This modification adds one call to HKDF per key.
The number of partitioning oracle queries remains unchanged.) As a result, the PSK
must therefore be chosen with sufficient entropy so that m + log k is prohibitive for
attackers (e.g., 2^128). Future specifications can define new AEAD algorithms that
are key-committing.

## Domain Separation {#domain-separation}

HPKE allows combining a DHKEM variant `DHKEM(Group, KDF')` and a KDF
such that both KDFs are instantiated by the same KDF. By design, the
calls to `Extract()` and `Expand()` inside DHKEM and the remainder of
HPKE use separate input domains. This justifies modeling them as
independent functions even if instantiated by the same KDF.
This domain separation between DHKEM and the remainder of HPKE is achieved by
using prefix-free sets of `suite_id` values in `LabeledExtract()`,
`LabeledExpand()`, and LabeledDerive (`KEM...` in DHKEM and `HPKE...` in the remainder of HPKE).
Recall that a set is prefix-free if no element is a prefix of another within the
set.

Separation between uses of the one-stage and two-stage KDFs is ensured by the
inclusion of the `suite_id` in `LabeledExtract`, `LabeledExpand`, and
`LabeledDerive`.

Future KEM instantiations MUST ensure, should `Extract()`,
`Expand()`, and/or `Derive()` be used internally, that they can be modeled as functions
independent from the invocations of these functions in the
remainder of HPKE. One way to ensure this is by using `LabeledExtract()` /
`LabeledExpand()` / `LabeledDerive()` functions with a `suite_id` as defined in {{base-crypto}},
which will ensure input domain separation, as outlined above.
Particular attention needs to
be paid if the KEM directly invokes functions that are used internally
in HPKE's `Extract()` or `Expand()`, such as `Hash()` and `HMAC()` in the case of HKDF.
It MUST be ensured that inputs to these invocations cannot collide with
inputs to the internal invocations of these functions inside `Extract()` or
`Expand()`. In HPKE's `KeySchedule()` this is avoided by using `Extract()` instead of
`Hash()` on the arbitrary-length inputs `info` and `psk_id`.

The string literal "HPKE-v1" used in `LabeledExtract()` / `LabeledExpand()` / `LabeledDerive()`
ensures that any secrets derived in HPKE are bound to the scheme's name
and version, even when possibly derived from the same Diffie-Hellman or
KEM shared secret as in another scheme or version.

## Application Embedding and Non-Goals {#non-goals}

HPKE is designed to be a fairly low-level mechanism.  As a result, it assumes
that certain properties are provided by the application in which HPKE is
embedded and leaves certain security properties to be provided by other
mechanisms. Otherwise said, certain properties are out-of-scope for HPKE.

### Message Order and Message Loss

The primary requirement that HPKE imposes on applications is the requirement
that ciphertexts MUST be presented to `ContextR.Open()` in the same order in
which they were generated by `ContextS.Seal()`.  When the single-shot API is
used (see {{single-shot-apis}}), this is trivially true (since there is only
ever one ciphertext.  Applications that allow for multiple invocations of
`Open()` / `Seal()` on the same context MUST enforce the ordering property
described above.

Ordering requirements of this character are usually fulfilled by providing a
sequence number in the framing of encrypted messages.  Whatever information is
used to determine the ordering of HPKE-encrypted messages SHOULD be included in
the AAD passed to `ContextS.Seal()` and `ContextR.Open()`.  The specifics of
this scheme are up to the application.

HPKE is not tolerant of lost messages. Applications MUST be able to detect when
a message has been lost.  When an unrecoverable loss is detected, the application MUST discard
any associated HPKE context.

### Downgrade Prevention

HPKE assumes that the sender and recipient agree on what algorithms to use.
Depending on how these algorithms are negotiated, it may be possible for an
intermediary to force the two parties to use suboptimal algorithms.

### Replay Protection

The requirement that ciphertexts be presented to the `ContextR.Open()` function
in the same order they were generated by `ContextS.Seal()` provides a degree of
replay protection within a stream of ciphertexts resulting from a given context.
HPKE provides no other replay protection.

### Forward Secrecy

HPKE ciphertexts are not forward secret with respect to recipient compromise
in any mode. This means that compromise of long-term recipient secrets allows
an attacker to decrypt past ciphertexts encrypted under said secrets. This is because
only long-term secrets are used on the side of the recipient.

HPKE ciphertexts are forward secret with respect to sender compromise in all
modes. This is because ephemeral randomness is used on the sender's side, which
is supposed to be erased directly after computation of the KEM shared secret and
ciphertext.

### Bad Ephemeral Randomness

If the randomness used for KEM encapsulation is bad -- i.e., of low entropy or
compromised because of a broken or subverted random number generator -- the
confidentiality guarantees of HPKE degrade significantly. In Base mode,
confidentiality guarantees can be lost completely; in the other modes, at least forward secrecy with
respect to sender compromise can be lost completely.

Such a situation could also lead to the reuse of the same KEM shared secret
and thus to the reuse of same key-nonce pairs for the AEAD.
The AEADs specified in this document are not secure
in case of nonce reuse. This attack vector is particularly relevant in
the authenticated mode because knowledge of the ephemeral randomness is not
enough to derive `shared_secret` in these modes.

One way for applications to mitigate the impacts of bad ephemeral randomness is
to combine ephemeral randomness with a local long-term secret that has been
generated securely, as described in {{?RFC8937}}.

### Hiding Plaintext Length

AEAD ciphertexts produced by HPKE do not hide the plaintext length. Applications
requiring this level of privacy should use a suitable padding mechanism. See
{{?I-D.ietf-tls-esni}} and {{?RFC8467}} for examples of protocol-specific
padding policies.

## Bidirectional Encryption {#bidirectional}

As discussed in {{hpke-dem}}, HPKE encryption is unidirectional from sender
to recipient. Applications that require bidirectional encryption can derive
necessary keying material with the secret export interface {{hpke-export}}.
The type and length of such keying material depends on the application use
case.

As an example, if an application needs AEAD encryption from the recipient to
the sender, it can derive a key and nonce from the corresponding HPKE context
as follows:

~~~
key = context.Export("response key", Nk)
nonce = context.Export("response nonce", Nn)
~~~

In this example, the length of each secret is based on the AEAD algorithm
used for the corresponding HPKE context.

Note that HPKE's limitations with regard to sender authentication become limits
on recipient authentication in this context. In particular, in the Base mode,
there is no authentication of the remote party at all.

## Metadata Protection

The PSK mode of HPKE requires that the recipient
know what key material to use for the sender.  This can be signaled in
applications by sending the PSK ID (`psk_id` above) and/or the sender's public
key (`pkS`).  However, these values themselves might be considered sensitive,
since, in a given application context, they might identify the sender.

An application that wishes to protect these metadata values without requiring
further provisioning of keys can use an additional instance of HPKE, using the
unauthenticated Base mode.  Where the application might have sent `(psk_id,
enc, ciphertext)` before, it would now send `(enc2, ciphertext2, enc, ciphertext)`,
where `(enc2, ciphertext2)` represent the encryption of the `psk_id` value.

The cost of this approach is an additional KEM operation each for the sender and
the recipient.  A potential lower-cost approach (involving only symmetric
operations) would be available if the nonce-protection schemes in {{BNT19}}
could be extended to cover other metadata.  However, this construction would
require further analysis.

# Message Encoding {#message-encoding}

This document does not specify a wire format encoding for HPKE messages. Applications
that adopt HPKE must therefore specify an unambiguous encoding mechanism that includes,
minimally: the encapsulated value `enc`, ciphertext value(s) (and order if there are
multiple), and any info values that are not implicit. One example of a non-implicit
value is the recipient public key used for encapsulation, which may be needed if a
recipient has more than one public key.

The AEAD interface used in this document is based on {{RFC5116}}, which produces and
consumes a single ciphertext value. As discussed in {{RFC5116}}, this ciphertext value
contains the encrypted plaintext as well as any authentication data, encoded in a manner
described by the individual AEAD scheme. Some implementations are not structured in this
way, instead providing a separate ciphertext and authentication tag. When such
AEAD implementations are used in HPKE implementations, the HPKE implementation must combine
these inputs into a single ciphertext value within `Seal()` and parse them out within
`Open()`, where the parsing details are defined by the AEAD scheme. For example, with
the AES-GCM schemes specified in this document, the GCM authentication tag is placed in
the last Nt bytes of the ciphertext output.

# Test Vectors

Each section below contains test vectors for a single HPKE ciphersuite and
contains the following values:

1. Configuration information and private key material: This includes the `mode`, `info` string, HPKE
   ciphersuite identifiers (`kem_id`, `kdf_id`, `aead_id`), and all
   sender, recipient, and ephemeral key material. For each role X,
   where X is one of S, R, or E, as sender, recipient, and ephemeral,
   respectively, key pairs are generated as `(skX, pkX) = DeriveKeyPair(ikmX)`.
   Each key pair `(skX, pkX)` is written in its serialized form, where

   For applicable modes, the shared PSK and PSK identifier are also included.
2. Context creation intermediate values and outputs: This includes the
   KEM outputs `enc` and `shared_secret` used to create the context, along
   with intermediate values `key_schedule_context` and `secret` computed
   in the KeySchedule function in {{encryption-context}}. The outputs
   include the context values `key`, `base_nonce`, and `exporter_secret`.
3. Encryption test vectors: A fixed plaintext message is encrypted using
   different sequence numbers and AAD values using the context computed in (2).
   Each test vector lists the sequence number and corresponding nonce computed
   with `base_nonce`, the plaintext message `pt`, AAD `aad`, and output
   ciphertext `ct`.
4. Export test vectors: Several exported values of the same length with differing
   context parameters are computed using the context computed in (2). Each test
   vector lists the `exporter_context`, output length `L`, and resulting export
   value.

These test vectors are also available in JSON format at {{TestVectors}}.
